# Python-Primes
I originally made this for a school project, but I thought the entire idea was interesting.

Using the prime_factor function, you can get a combination of prime numbers that are all factors of
the number you put in.

using test_is_prime, you can test if a number is prime. However, this won't really work unless you use
find_primes up to the number that you want to test.

There is a maximum argument to find_primes. Set it too high, and you won't be using your Python kernel
for anything in the near future, unless you restart it.

find_twin_primes is sorta like find_primes, except it finds primes that have a difference of two. Still
has a maximum argument.
